# 🐾 ResQtail

**Real-Time Rescue Coordination for Stray and Injured Animals**

> A smart and compassionate solution to improve animal rescue workflows using location tracking, real-time updates, structured reporting, and a connected volunteer network.

---

## 📘 Abstract

With growing urban populations and a rising number of stray or injured animals, traditional rescue methods—relying on manual calls and social media—are slow and uncoordinated. This results in delayed intervention and compromised animal welfare.

**ResQtail** is a unified digital platform designed to transform how animal rescue is reported and managed. It enables the public to submit precise, location-based rescue alerts with media evidence, which are routed directly to nearby shelters and volunteers. With real-time tracking, chat support, and case management features, ResQtail fosters a faster, more organized, and compassionate rescue ecosystem.
